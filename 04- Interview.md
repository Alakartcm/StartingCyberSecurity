# Interview

Here we are. You've identified your target role, you've prepared, and you've applied for roles you think you would be a great fit for. Now you have the interview. The internet is full of material about having a successful interviews. While I don't have a revolutionized method or 10 steps to a successful interview, I can share what has been successful for me in the past. At this time I want to iterate that this is based on my experience and I encourage you to seek other perspectives as well.

## Before the Interview

If you have been following along, you have already done most of the preparation for the interview. You've done what you can to present yourself, so now is the time to know a little about the where you are interviewing.

Before an interview, I normally like to find this kind of information for the company I am interviewing with:

1. What good or service do they provide?
2. What is the Job Description, how long has it been open?
3. If they are publicly traded, what does there stock look like?
4. Who are your potential peers and managers?
5. What is the company mission statement?
6. What are some recent major events for the company?

Some of this information is easy to acquire, such as question one. Other information might not be available at all. the idea is to have an understanding of the role that goes beyond the technical. This information could be relevant during the interview. Let's take question one for example, which give you a talking point or question relating your technical skills to the role. 

Let's imagine you are applying to a company called "Spacely Space Sprockets", a company that manufactures sprockets, for a SOC Analyst role. Here is how we can take the information we uncovered from question one to a talking point during the interview:

"What kind of Cyber Threats does a company such as yours perceive as a priority? Perhaps insider threats leaking intellectual property or loss of revenue from the ecommerce platform being down do to attack?"

In the above example, we identified the company as a provider of a good that relies on innovation and online availability to generate revenue. So we take this information and relate it to what kind of role you are applying for. In my experience, questions such as these can leave a lasting impact.

### Before we move on

Some people get nervous prior to going in for an interview. I am one of those people. I find it helpful to arrive at the interview site early enough to take a few minutes to breathe and relax. I encourage you to take on a similar exercise if interviews make you nervous. Remember that they want to talk to you so there is something they are interested in and it's just a conversation. You've got this!

Be sure to enter the building early! Great any of the staff in front in a friendly manner, you never know who they are and what influence they have. You're here, let's do this! 

## During the Interview

The assistant has escorted you to a meeting room and has asked if you would like something to drink. You politely accept a water, and wait for the interview panel to arrive.

You're here now. You've put in the work and you've done the research. Let's go!

1. Greetings
2. Demeanor
3. Technical
4. Questions
5. Exit

### Greetings

Upon entry, be sure to greet your interview panel and introduce yourself.

### Demeanor

There is potential for questions to be built into your interview meant to keep you on your toes or take you out of your comfort zone. Don't let this fluster you! Maintain your composure and answer truthfully.

### Technical

This is the portion of the interview your preparations will come into play. This is your opportunity to demonstrate how your skills can add value to the company! Pull from your portfolio as the conversation dictates. When asked about certifications, try to work in your study methodology as opposed to just the test.

### Questions

Always try to ask questions when given the opportunity. This is a great place to leverage the information you gathered before the interview to ask relevant questions! 


### Exit

At the end of the interview, be sure to thank the interview panel for their time. It's okay to ask when you can expect to hear from them.

## After the Interview

The interview is over, now the sweat of waiting to here back from the company you interviewed with. There is nothing else you can do......or is there?

1. The follow up
2. Learning from the interview
3. Keep going

### The Follow up

After the interview, I typically like to wait one business day, send a follow up email to whoever you have been communicating with. Let them know you enjoyed meeting the interview panel and you look forward to hearing back from them! 

### Learning from the Interview

I have yet to deliver the perfect interview. I can always identify an area I think I could improve. It is important to reflect on the interview and think on it objectively. Identify what you think worked for you and what didn't. Take what you learn, and if you for some reason do not land the job, take those learnings and apply them to the next interview.

### Keep Going

Most of us have been rejected after an interview. It's not always something you did or didn't do, sometimes it really isn't a good fit. As I mentioned before, don't make rejection your identity. Keep on the lookout for other opportunities, apply what you learned and go back in!
