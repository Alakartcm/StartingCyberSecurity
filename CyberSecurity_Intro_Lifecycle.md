# Introduction

Throughout my career I've been asked multiple times "How do I get into Cyber Security"? As this profession has become more and more integral to all sectors through the years I thought it was time to compile my thoughts and recommendations in a place I could easily reference and share. This idea evolved into what I am dubbing Cyber Security Intro Lifecycle (name is subject to change). 

## Disclaimer

This project is in no way a guarantee of employment and only reflects my experiences in the industry. Everyone's journey is different and I encourage you to seek out others and learn about their experiences as well! 

## Cyber Security Intro Lifecycle

1. Identify- Identify the type of job Cyber Security job you want.
2. Prepare- Prepare yourself with the knowledge needed for the identified job.
3. Hunt- Hunt for the types of jobs you identified or jobs that will provide experience to get you there. 
4. Interview- Landing the job
5. Grow- Grow within your new role, get what you can
6. Repeat- Careers are long, your goals with grow and change.

# Identify


## Summary

The first phase of the lifecycle if identifying what kind of job you want to target. Don't Panic! It's okay if this changes along the way. Cyber Security is a massive field that has many different roles to choose from. To complicate things even further, your specific industry can have different expectations. Below I have tried to break down different "Silos" of security roles as well as example roles that fall within them.

## Categories

2. Incident Responder
3. Forensic Analyst
### Security Design

#### Example Roles

1. Security Architect
2. Security Engineer
3. Cloud Security Engineer
4. SecDevOps

### Security Compliance

#### Example Roles

## Industries

Note: This is a basic list and is by no means exhaustive.

1. Government- Agencies that make up the function of a government (EPA, FBI, DHS, CISA,)
2. Financial- Entities that facilitate the storage and transfer of wealth. ( Banks, Crypto Wallets, Investment Firms)
3. Healthcare- Entities that deal with health related data. (Hospitals, Doctors Offices)

6. Telecommunications- Entities that facilitate the transmission and reception or communications (Cell Service Providers, Television Stations, Internet Service Providers)

## Deciding what is right for you

You might be asking yourself, which of these roles are right for me? While that is a question you will have to answer yourself, you can make informed decisions by understanding what these different roles do and what roles they typically feed into down the line.

# Prepare

## Summary

The second phase of the life cycle is to prepare. During this phase we will prepare for interviews of our target roles. We can accomplish this by doing the following:

1. Brush up on recent developments concerning said role
2. Practice skills relevant to the role.
3. Obtain Certifications
4. Prepare a portfolio.
5. Prepare for the interview
## Brushing up on recent developments

When you land the interview, being able to speak on topics of interest to the role is a huge win! This demonstrates a desire to excel in your chosen role. This is especially effective if that recent development pertains to both the employers business and cyber security. For example, when interviewing for a SOC role at a retail organization asking a question such as this could set you apart from other candidates.

"I've recently read about a threat actor group that is targeting retail organizations, has your company taken steps to detect their known IOC's or evaluated how your security stack holds up against their operating procedures? "

Another example when applying for a vulnerability analyst role at a financial institution: 

" There have been several reports that hackers are exploiting a vulnerability that was disclosed 2 months ago. Can you describe to me how this role can accelerate the response to disclosed vulnerabilities to ensure that doesn't happen to you?"

Both of these questions show that you have taken an interest in your career and that you can add value to team that is hiring.

### Staying up to date?

Cyber security moves quickly and the volume of news is almost impossible to keep up with across all of Cybersecurity. Creating your own news feeds that fit you specific targeted role is can go a long way to being able to quickly come up to speed on recent events. Ways I have done this in the past:

1. RSS feeds- curate a list of RSS feeds from Blogs and News Sources that target your desired role.
2. YouTube Channels- Similarly to above, curate a list of YouTube creators who are doing what you want to do. 
3. Social Media- Follow professionals who talk about content related to your desired role. This is a great way to stay on top happenings as information gets shared. In section below I have listed some content creators who I enjoy as an example. 
4. Conferences/Meetings- Attending conferences or attending meetups is another way to stay up to date. Not only does networking benefit your job search and knowledge, but it is also a great way to meet some awesome people. Volunteering in these events can potentially lead to even more opportunities. Contacting local organizations such as your local ISSA chapter would be a good place to start.
5. AI- This one is a bonus, but there are many well documented flows using AI to parse through news sources and deliver a curated list of news! You can use an automation framework such as n8n and a popular AI provider to deliver a list of news link relevant to specific topics. This has the added benefit of a project to add to your portfolio (Discussed in a later section!

## Practice skills relevant to the role.

In this section we will discuss the importance of practical experience and how you might be able to obtain it. Options include:
1. CTF's and Cyber Ranges
2. Participate in Training
3. Home Lab
4. Obtain Certifications

### CTF's & Cyber Ranges

Participating in CTFs or CTF like activities are a great way to grow your skills. In some cases, there is a cost to participate.

#### What is a CTF?

The acronym CTF stand for "Capture The Flag". During a CTF, you are given one or more objectives, or flags, to obtain. In competitive CTF's, you are times and each objective is assigned a point value. For our purposes though we will be looking to use this as a way to practice our skills.

#### Where can I find CTF's?

What I have listed below either have free options and/or low cost options to start practicing. You can also potentially find CTF's at conferences or vendor hosted events.

### Participate in Training

Training can sound daunting at first and on the surface can look expensive in some cases! Our goal is to keep costs down and the quality high! What I have listed below are some free or low cost training resources that might be of use.

### Home Lab

#### What is a home lab?

At it's core, a home lab is an environment you can use to experiment and practice your skills. The lab could be physical pieces of equipment, a virtual environment, or a cloud hosted solution. 

#### Getting Started

How do you get started with a home lab? My personal recommendation is to begin with a type2 hypervisor such as [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and begin small. Another option would be find an old server second hand (such as on ebay or your college) that support virtualization and build a dedicated lab using a Type 1 hypervisor such as [proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/).

Below I have linked to some useful home lab resources that could be beneficial while exploring this option.

[10 tips for homelab 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7yaDAnD_xc)


### Obtain Certifications

Another way to practice your skills is to pursue certifications. Certifications demonstrate that you have obtained a certain body of knowledge as well as a desire to improve your skills. The amount of certifications can be a bit overwhelming, so below I have provided resources below that could help you align your goals with relevant certifications. It is beyond the scope of this project to discuss certification paths, but there is certainly content out there that can help. Please note this is not an endorsement for any certification or the entities who provide them. 


[Cyber Security Certification Roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/)
[CyberDefenders Roadmap](https://cyberdefenders.org/community/cybersecurity-roadmap/)

Another thing to note is that if you participate in training as noted above, some trainings can also lead to certifications. 

## Prepare a Portfolio

### Summary

It is likely if you are interviewing, you already have a resume. While that is a great start, I prefer to have a toolbox of different tools I can leverage to demonstrate my commitment to improve, passion for the industry, and technical knowledge. We will call this our portfolio. What can go into a portfolio?

1. Resume
2. Social Media
3. Bodies of Work
### Resume

As mentioned in the summary, a resume is a great starting point. This is the first thing an employer is going to see. Writing effective resume's is a topic that has been covered in great detail on the internet,  so I will point you to some of my favorite content on the subject:

[Cyber Insecurity Resume Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wejL0ll__uQ&list=PLqEPHR4iX_BJRT6qDSSNy2sWgbaPlxx1p)
[Some example resume templates](https://resumeworded.com/cyber-security-resume-examples#cyber-security-analyst)
[Beam Jobs](https://www.beamjobs.com/resumes/cyber-security-resume-examples)

### Social Media

#### Words of Caution

Before we dive into this topic, I would like to offer some advice. If you are going to use social media as a part of your portfolio, you are essentially representing your "professional self" on these accounts. My advice would be to either create a separate account for your professional posts and activities, or keep your social media clean of any potentially embarrassing behavior (meaning anything you wouldn't want your employer to see).

Using a social media presence as part of your portfolio comes with it's own risks. You are exposing a public persona to the wider internet for better or worse. It is potentially opening you harassment, doxing, or other negative interactions. I would suggest that you start with something relatively safe like LinkedIn and move on to other platforms if you feel the desire to.

### Use Cases

So why use social media as part of your portfolio? it represents a public presence and engagement with the industry. I have included some examples below of how some platforms can be used:

1. [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/)- The premier career oriented social media platform. Obvious uses for this platform are searching and applying for roles (which we will cover in a later section). Imagine this, you are hiring for a junior cyber security analyst and you receive 2 applicants through LinkedIn. Candidate 1 has posts regarding things they are learning, news articles they found interesting, and positive comments on other posts. Candidate 2 has a profile that is a ghost town outside of a couple "looking for work" posts. Which candidate sounds more appealing? LinkedIn is a great platform to talk about certifications and projects you are working on as well as sharing interesting media related to your profession. Make efforts to add some content on a regular basis.
2. [X](https://x.com/)/[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)/[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/)- I have grouped these sites together for the purpose of simplicity. As mentioned above, following prominent figures in the industry has it's own advantages. Taking it a step further and interacting with industry professionals, sharing insightful posts, and even writing your own posts demonstrates active engagement in the community. 


### Bodies of Work

A body of work can be anything you can reference as having worked on. From your own website to a code repository you can demonstrate competence, experience, and growth by adding this to your portfolio. Examples:

1. Personal Website
2. Blog Posts/Podcasts/Video Content
3. Code Repository
4. Contributions to Opensource Projects

#### Personal Website/Domain

I am a big fan of this. Building your own website demonstrates some amount of technical fluency and allows you to either hose or link to your content such as contact info, resume, GitHub projects, YouTube channel, news feeds and more! This website can essentially be your personal brand. Think of this as the "show" to the resume's "tell". 

#### Blog Posts/Podcasts/Video Content

Making content related to the type of role you are looking for can be a big advantage. Like many other items discussed, it demonstrates passion and commitment. This can also allow potential employers the things you are working on and how it might relate to the role they are hiring for.

#### Code Repository

If you write any code that you feel making available to the world, host it in a public space and reference your work in your resume/online presence. Obviously do not share any code that might be proprietary to a previous role as this could lead to situations you would rather not be in. 

#### Contribute to Opensource Projects

There are tons of opensource projects out there. Being involved in them will help you three fold: 
1. You can reference your work to your potential employers (see Code Repo Above)
2. You will develop your skills by working on these projects
3. You have the potential for networking with future colleagues. 


## Preparing for the interview

I know this step seems a little out of place. There is a method to my madness however! In my opinion, preparation for the interview starts before you apply for a role or speak to a recruiter. We've got to tools for the task, now let's land that role!
