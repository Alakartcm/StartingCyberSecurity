# Introduction

Throughout my career I've been asked multiple times "How do I get into Cyber Security"? As this profession has become more and more integral to all sectors through the years I thought it was time to compile my thoughts and recommendations in a place I could easily reference and share. This idea evolved into what I am dubbing Cyber Security Intro Lifecycle (name is subject to change). 

## Disclaimer

This project is in no way a guarantee of employment and only reflects my experiences in the industry. Everyone's journey is different and I encourage you to seek out others and learn about their experiences as well! 

## Cyber Security Intro Lifecycle

1. Identify- Identify the type of job Cyber Security job you want.
2. Prepare- Prepare yourself with the knowledge needed for the identified job.
3. Hunt- Hunt for the types of jobs you identified or jobs that will provide experience to get you there. 
4. Interview- Landing the job
5. Grow- Grow within your new role, get what you can
6. Repeat- Careers are long, your goals with grow and change.

# Identify


## Summary

The first phase of the lifecycle if identifying what kind of job you want to target. Don't Panic! It's okay if this changes along the way. Cyber Security is a massive field that has many different roles to choose from. To complicate things even further, your specific industry can have different expectations. Below I have tried to break down different "Silos" of security roles as well as example roles that fall within them.

## Categories

### Proactive Security

#### Example Roles
1. Penetration Tester
2. Red Teamer
3. Vulnerability Analyst
4. Bug Bounty 
5. Threat Hunter

### Reactive Security

#### Example Roles

1. SOC Analyst
2. Incident Responder
3. Forensic Analyst
### Security Design

#### Example Roles

1. Security Architect
2. Security Engineer
3. Cloud Security Engineer
4. SecDevOps

### Security Compliance

#### Example Roles

1. Security Compliance Analyst
2. Security Compliance Auditor

## Industries

Note: This is a basic list and is by no means exhaustive.

1. Government- Agencies that make up the function of a government (EPA, FBI, DHS, CISA,)
2. Financial- Entities that facilitate the storage and transfer of wealth. ( Banks, Crypto Wallets, Investment Firms)
3. Healthcare- Entities that deal with health related data. (Hospitals, Doctors Offices)
4. Retail and Hospitality- Entities that supply good and services to people (Restaurants, Department Stores, Hotels )
5. Big Tech- Entities that develop and maintain large technical projects or infrastructure (Cloud Platforms, Artificial Intelligence)
6. Telecommunications- Entities that facilitate the transmission and reception or communications (Cell Service Providers, Television Stations, Internet Service Providers)

## Deciding what is right for you

You might be asking yourself, which of these roles are right for me? While that is a question you will have to answer yourself, you can make informed decisions by understanding what these different roles do and what roles they typically feed into down the line.

### Resources

#### Role Descriptions

[CyberSN has a list of Cyber Security roles and brief descriptions of each](https://cybersn.com/45-cybersecurity-roles/)

[Cyberseek has published a rudimentary career map with roles and required skills.](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html)

[shellsharks Cyber Security Role Mind Map](https://shellsharks.com/cybersecurity-role-map)



# Prepare

## Summary

The second phase of the life cycle is to prepare. During this phase we will prepare for interviews of our target roles. We can accomplish this by doing the following:

1. Brush up on recent developments concerning said role
2. Practice skills relevant to the role.
3. Obtain Certifications
4. Prepare a portfolio.
5. Prepare for the interview
## Brushing up on recent developments

When you land the interview, being able to speak on topics of interest to the role is a huge win! This demonstrates a desire to excel in your chosen role. This is especially effective if that recent development pertains to both the employers business and cyber security. For example, when interviewing for a SOC role at a retail organization asking a question such as this could set you apart from other candidates.

"I've recently read about a threat actor group that is targeting retail organizations, has your company taken steps to detect their known IOC's or evaluated how your security stack holds up against their operating procedures? "

Another example when applying for a vulnerability analyst role at a financial institution: 

" There have been several reports that hackers are exploiting a vulnerability that was disclosed 2 months ago. Can you describe to me how this role can accelerate the response to disclosed vulnerabilities to ensure that doesn't happen to you?"

Both of these questions show that you have taken an interest in your career and that you can add value to team that is hiring.

### Staying up to date?

Cyber security moves quickly and the volume of news is almost impossible to keep up with across all of Cybersecurity. Creating your own news feeds that fit you specific targeted role is can go a long way to being able to quickly come up to speed on recent events. Ways I have done this in the past:

1. RSS feeds- curate a list of RSS feeds from Blogs and News Sources that target your desired role.
2. YouTube Channels- Similarly to above, curate a list of YouTube creators who are doing what you want to do. 
3. Social Media- Follow professionals who talk about content related to your desired role. This is a great way to stay on top happenings as information gets shared. In section below I have listed some content creators who I enjoy as an example. 
4. Conferences/Meetings- Attending conferences or attending meetups is another way to stay up to date. Not only does networking benefit your job search and knowledge, but it is also a great way to meet some awesome people. Volunteering in these events can potentially lead to even more opportunities. Contacting local organizations such as your local ISSA chapter would be a good place to start.
5. AI- This one is a bonus, but there are many well documented flows using AI to parse through news sources and deliver a curated list of news! You can use an automation framework such as n8n and a popular AI provider to deliver a list of news link relevant to specific topics. This has the added benefit of a project to add to your portfolio (Discussed in a later section!

## Practice skills relevant to the role.

In this section we will discuss the importance of practical experience and how you might be able to obtain it. Options include:
1. CTF's and Cyber Ranges
2. Participate in Training
3. Home Lab
4. Obtain Certifications

### CTF's & Cyber Ranges

Participating in CTFs or CTF like activities are a great way to grow your skills. In some cases, there is a cost to participate.

#### What is a CTF?

The acronym CTF stand for "Capture The Flag". During a CTF, you are given one or more objectives, or flags, to obtain. In competitive CTF's, you are times and each objective is assigned a point value. For our purposes though we will be looking to use this as a way to practice our skills.

#### Where can I find CTF's?

What I have listed below either have free options and/or low cost options to start practicing. You can also potentially find CTF's at conferences or vendor hosted events.

[uscyberange](https://www.uscyberrange.org/pricing/)
[picoctf](https://picoctf.org/)


### Participate in Training

Training can sound daunting at first and on the surface can look expensive in some cases! Our goal is to keep costs down and the quality high! What I have listed below are some free or low cost training resources that might be of use.

[coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
[AWS Skill Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/)
[Professor Messer](https://www.professormesser.com/)

### Home Lab

#### What is a home lab?

At it's core, a home lab is an environment you can use to experiment and practice your skills. The lab could be physical pieces of equipment, a virtual environment, or a cloud hosted solution. 

#### Getting Started

How do you get started with a home lab? My personal recommendation is to begin with a type2 hypervisor such as [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and begin small. Another option would be find an old server second hand (such as on ebay or your college) that support virtualization and build a dedicated lab using a Type 1 hypervisor such as [proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/).

Below I have linked to some useful home lab resources that could be beneficial while exploring this option.

[10 tips for homelab 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7yaDAnD_xc)


### Obtain Certifications

Another way to practice your skills is to pursue certifications. Certifications demonstrate that you have obtained a certain body of knowledge as well as a desire to improve your skills. The amount of certifications can be a bit overwhelming, so below I have provided resources below that could help you align your goals with relevant certifications. It is beyond the scope of this project to discuss certification paths, but there is certainly content out there that can help. Please note this is not an endorsement for any certification or the entities who provide them. 


[Cyber Security Certification Roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/)
[CyberDefenders Roadmap](https://cyberdefenders.org/community/cybersecurity-roadmap/)

Another thing to note is that if you participate in training as noted above, some trainings can also lead to certifications. 

## Prepare a Portfolio

### Summary

It is likely if you are interviewing, you already have a resume. While that is a great start, I prefer to have a toolbox of different tools I can leverage to demonstrate my commitment to improve, passion for the industry, and technical knowledge. We will call this our portfolio. What can go into a portfolio?

1. Resume
2. Social Media
3. Bodies of Work
### Resume

As mentioned in the summary, a resume is a great starting point. This is the first thing an employer is going to see. Writing effective resume's is a topic that has been covered in great detail on the internet,  so I will point you to some of my favorite content on the subject:

[Cyber Insecurity Resume Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wejL0ll__uQ&list=PLqEPHR4iX_BJRT6qDSSNy2sWgbaPlxx1p)
[Some example resume templates](https://resumeworded.com/cyber-security-resume-examples#cyber-security-analyst)
[Beam Jobs](https://www.beamjobs.com/resumes/cyber-security-resume-examples)

### Social Media

#### Words of Caution

Before we dive into this topic, I would like to offer some advice. If you are going to use social media as a part of your portfolio, you are essentially representing your "professional self" on these accounts. My advice would be to either create a separate account for your professional posts and activities, or keep your social media clean of any potentially embarrassing behavior (meaning anything you wouldn't want your employer to see).

Using a social media presence as part of your portfolio comes with it's own risks. You are exposing a public persona to the wider internet for better or worse. It is potentially opening you harassment, doxing, or other negative interactions. I would suggest that you start with something relatively safe like LinkedIn and move on to other platforms if you feel the desire to.

### Use Cases

So why use social media as part of your portfolio? it represents a public presence and engagement with the industry. I have included some examples below of how some platforms can be used:

1. [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/)- The premier career oriented social media platform. Obvious uses for this platform are searching and applying for roles (which we will cover in a later section). Imagine this, you are hiring for a junior cyber security analyst and you receive 2 applicants through LinkedIn. Candidate 1 has posts regarding things they are learning, news articles they found interesting, and positive comments on other posts. Candidate 2 has a profile that is a ghost town outside of a couple "looking for work" posts. Which candidate sounds more appealing? LinkedIn is a great platform to talk about certifications and projects you are working on as well as sharing interesting media related to your profession. Make efforts to add some content on a regular basis.
2. [X](https://x.com/)/[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)/[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/)- I have grouped these sites together for the purpose of simplicity. As mentioned above, following prominent figures in the industry has it's own advantages. Taking it a step further and interacting with industry professionals, sharing insightful posts, and even writing your own posts demonstrates active engagement in the community. 


### Bodies of Work

A body of work can be anything you can reference as having worked on. From your own website to a code repository you can demonstrate competence, experience, and growth by adding this to your portfolio. Examples:

1. Personal Website
2. Blog Posts/Podcasts/Video Content
3. Code Repository
4. Contributions to Opensource Projects

#### Personal Website/Domain

I am a big fan of this. Building your own website demonstrates some amount of technical fluency and allows you to either hose or link to your content such as contact info, resume, GitHub projects, YouTube channel, news feeds and more! This website can essentially be your personal brand. Think of this as the "show" to the resume's "tell". 

#### Blog Posts/Podcasts/Video Content

Making content related to the type of role you are looking for can be a big advantage. Like many other items discussed, it demonstrates passion and commitment. This can also allow potential employers the things you are working on and how it might relate to the role they are hiring for.

#### Code Repository

If you write any code that you feel making available to the world, host it in a public space and reference your work in your resume/online presence. Obviously do not share any code that might be proprietary to a previous role as this could lead to situations you would rather not be in. 

#### Contribute to Opensource Projects

There are tons of opensource projects out there. Being involved in them will help you three fold: 
1. You can reference your work to your potential employers (see Code Repo Above)
2. You will develop your skills by working on these projects
3. You have the potential for networking with future colleagues. 


## Preparing for the interview

I know this step seems a little out of place. There is a method to my madness however! In my opinion, preparation for the interview starts before you apply for a role or speak to a recruiter. We've got to tools for the task, now let's land that role! 

What can we do to prepare for the interview?

1. Comfort with the subject matter
2. Knowing your worth
3. Having an eye catching resume
4. Knowing your limits

### Comfort level with the subject matter

You may be more or less comfortable with the material related to the role you seek than you think. How comfortable are you describing the "three way handshake" or "how a cross site scripting attack works". You may understand in your mind how these things work, but have you every tried explaining it? 

Luckily, there are ways to practice. You could find a list of common interview questions for your role and answer them out loud. If might feel uncomfortable speaking when there is no one around to hear, but trust me it helps!

If you have a mentor or a peer group you can converse with, discuss related topics with them! You will be amazed how quickly you learn to discuss these topics! 

#### Interview Experience

Similarly to the points above, gaining experience in an interview setting is a great way to prepare yourself for the real deal! Outside of sitting for actual interviews you can arrange a mock interview. A mock interview is exactly what it sounds like, it gives you the opportunity to practice your comfort level in an interview setting. Local career centers, mentor's, or peers might be willing to help you with this. Cyber Security Conventions and ISSA chapter's may also have these resource available. 


### Knowing your worth

Let's be honest, there are some less than ethical recruiting processes in the world. There will be those who want to hire top talent for bottom dollar. This is where you establish "your number". Your number is the very lowest amount you would be willing to work for. Don't forget to account for benefits in your estimation! If you go in knowing your bottom number you can navigate the hiring process much easier.

Below I have provided some resources that may help you arrive at "your number". These are not perfect numbers, and always be sure to account for your situation and location. While Cyber Security is fun and experience is valuable but you need to earn enough to support yourself.

[GlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/cyber-security-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm)
[stationx](https://www.stationx.net/how-much-do-cyber-security-jobs-pay/)
[coursera](https://www.coursera.org/articles/cybersecurity-salary)

### Having an Eye Catching Resume

As mentioned in the Portfolio Section, a resume is an important piece to the portfolio. It is the first impression an potential employer will get of you. the topic of writing resume's has been covered heavily on the internet, so I will not go into theory here. Instead, I will once again direct you to the [Cyber Insecurity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wejL0ll__uQ&list=PLqEPHR4iX_BJRT6qDSSNy2sWgbaPlxx1p) channel and tell you the number one rule: DO NOT LIE ON YOUR RESUME. The ramifications of doing so could negatively impact your career for years to come.

### Knowing Your Limits

This is the counter point to comfort level. You need to accept you do not, nor will you be expected to, know everything. There are practitioners with decades of experience who don't know everything about their particular role. All of this to say be comfortable with saying "I don't know, but here is how I would find out.....". Being able to communicate you don't know the answer to a particular question but offering a methodology to discovering that answer is sometimes just as good or better than knowing the actual answer.

TLDR: Not knowing is fine, but offer a solution to finding the answer.


# Hunt

## Summary

You've worked through your preparations, now it's time to hunt for your role! In this section I have included resources that can be utilized in this process. I have broken these down into smaller sections:

1. Advice & Mental Game
2. Networking
3. Job Boards
4. Additional Resources

### Advice & Mental Game

Starting a career in cybersecurity can be challenging, especially in the early stages. You may interview and hear “not the right fit” or “we’re looking for more experience”—and sometimes you won’t hear back at all. That’s normal. Don’t let those moments define you. Use each step to sharpen your skills and story, stay focused on your path, and keep going. In fact, I encourage you to take as many interviews as possible! Gaining more experience interviewing will only help you achieve your goals.

The job hunting grind can be tedious and discouraging. Make sure to take care of yourself and don't make failure your identity.

### Networking

What is networking? Well in this sense, it is cultivating contacts within the industry or industry adjacent professionals. There is an old adage of "It's not what you know, it's who you know", while that might not be completely true there is a benefit with connecting with people. You never know when someone you encounter might be the lead that brings you into your desired role!

#### How to network

1. Conferences- Meeting people face to face is a great way to network! Attending conferences is a great way to meet peers and like minded people who can help you grow. In return, as you gain experience you can help others grow as well!
2. Organizations- Join an organization such as ISSA and attend their meetups. This is a bit like conferences but on a smaller scale. You will meet people who are at different stages in their careers, get potential volunteering opportunities, and possibly even job leads! 
3. Digital Communities- Digital communities are social media sites, chat platforms, or forums. You can find groups on sites such as LinkedIn and Discord that share common interests to you. Participate in these communities and make friends/contacts!

### Job Boards

Here is a list of job boards in which you can hunt for jobs. There are many more out there so feel free to experiment! I've tried to limit this list to those boards that I have direct experience with or have heard positives reviews about. 

1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
2. [CyberSN](https://cybersn.com/public/search-jobs/)
3. [indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)
4. [dice](https://www.dice.com/)
5. [builtin](https://builtin.com/)

Outside of job boards it is worth going to the careers page of a company you are interested in working for. You can browse the offerings that a specific company has and apply directly from their careers page! 

### Additional Resources. 

In this section I want to shout out some additional resources that could be helpful in kickstarting your career.

#### Job Hunt Like a Hacker

Jason Blanchard has been providing "Job Hunt Like A Hacker" content for some time now. I recommend his methodology. Below you can find some of his content

He also does live streams which he announces on his [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/banjocrashland/)

# Interview

Here we are. You've identified your target role, you've prepared, and you've applied for roles you think you would be a great fit for. Now you have the interview. The internet is full of material about having a successful interviews. While I don't have a revolutionized method or 10 steps to a successful interview, I can share what has been successful for me in the past. At this time I want to iterate that this is based on my experience and I encourage you to seek other perspectives as well.

1. Before the Interview
2. During the Interview
3. After the Interview.

## Before the Interview

If you have been following along, you have already done most of the preparation for the interview. You've done what you can to present yourself, so now is the time to know a little about the where you are interviewing.

Before an interview, I normally like to find this kind of information for the company I am interviewing with:

1. What good or service do they provide?
2. What is the Job Description, how long has it been open?
3. If they are publicly traded, what does there stock look like?
4. Who are your potential peers and managers?
5. What is the company mission statement?
6. What are some recent major events for the company?

Some of this information is easy to acquire, such as question one. Other information might not be available at all. the idea is to have an understanding of the role that goes beyond the technical. This information could be relevant during the interview. Let's take question one for example, which give you a talking point or question relating your technical skills to the role. 

Let's imagine you are applying to a company called "Spacely Space Sprockets", a company that manufactures sprockets, for a SOC Analyst role. Here is how we can take the information we uncovered from question one to a talking point during the interview:

"What kind of Cyber Threats does a company such as yours perceive as a priority? Perhaps insider threats leaking intellectual property or loss of revenue from the ecommerce platform being down do to attack?"

In the above example, we identified the company as a provider of a good that relies on innovation and online availability to generate revenue. So we take this information and relate it to what kind of role you are applying for. In my experience, questions such as these can leave a lasting impact.

### Before we move on

Some people get nervous prior to going in for an interview. I am one of those people. I find it helpful to arrive at the interview site early enough to take a few minutes to breathe and relax. I encourage you to take on a similar exercise if interviews make you nervous. Remember that they want to talk to you so there is something they are interested in and it's just a conversation. You've got this!

Be sure to enter the building early! Great any of the staff in front in a friendly manner, you never know who they are and what influence they have. You're here, let's do this! 

## During the Interview

The assistant has escorted you to a meeting room and has asked if you would like something to drink. You politely accept a water, and wait for the interview panel to arrive.

You're here now. You've put in the work and you've done the research. Let's go!

1. Greetings
2. Demeanor
3. Technical
4. Questions
5. Exit

### Greetings

Upon entry, be sure to greet your interview panel and introduce yourself.

### Demeanor

There is potential for questions to be built into your interview meant to keep you on your toes or take you out of your comfort zone. Don't let this fluster you! Maintain your composure and answer truthfully.

### Technical

This is the portion of the interview your preparations will come into play. This is your opportunity to demonstrate how your skills can add value to the company! Pull from your portfolio as the conversation dictates. When asked about certifications, try to work in your study methodology as opposed to just the test.

### Questions

Always try to ask questions when given the opportunity. This is a great place to leverage the information you gathered before the interview to ask relevant questions! 


### Exit

At the end of the interview, be sure to thank the interview panel for their time. It's okay to ask when you can expect to hear from them.

## After the Interview

The interview is over, now the sweat of waiting to here back from the company you interviewed with. There is nothing else you can do......or is there?

1. The follow up
2. Learning from the interview
3. Keep going

### The Follow up

After the interview, I typically like to wait one business day, send a follow up email to whoever you have been communicating with. Let them know you enjoyed meeting the interview panel and you look forward to hearing back from them! 

### Learning from the Interview

I have yet to deliver the perfect interview. I can always identify an area I think I could improve. It is important to reflect on the interview and think on it objectively. Identify what you think worked for you and what didn't. Take what you learn, and if you for some reason do not land the job, take those learnings and apply them to the next interview.

### Keep Going

Most of us have been rejected after an interview. It's not always something you did or didn't do, sometimes it really isn't a good fit. As I mentioned before, don't make rejection your identity Keep on the lookout for other opportunities, apply what you learned and go back in!
