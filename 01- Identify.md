## Deciding what is right for you

You might be asking yourself, which of these roles and what industry is right for me? While that is a question you will have to answer yourself, you can make informed decisions by understanding how these roles apply to the different industries. For example, how does a SOC Analyst in a retail environment differ from a SOC Analyst in a financial environment?
