# Hunt

## Summary

You've worked through your preparations, now it's time to hunt for your role! In this section I have included resources that can be utilized in this process. I have broken these down into smaller sections:

1. Advice & Mental Game
2. Networking
3. Job Boards
4. Additional Resources

### Advice & Mental Game

Starting a career in cybersecurity can be challenging, especially in the early stages. You may interview and hear “not the right fit” or “we’re looking for more experience”—and sometimes you won’t hear back at all. That’s normal. Don’t let those moments define you. Use each step to sharpen your skills and story, stay focused on your path, and keep going. In fact, I encourage you to take as many interviews as possible! Gaining more experience interviewing will only help you achieve your goals.

The job hunting grind can be tedious and discouraging. Make sure to take care of yourself and don't make failure your identity. 

### Networking

What is networking? Well in this sense, it is cultivating contacts within the industry or industry adjacent professionals. There is an old adage of "It's not what you know, it's who you know", while that might not be completely true there is a benefit with connecting with people. You never know when someone you encounter might be the lead that brings you into your desired role!

#### How to network

1. Conferences- Meeting people face to face is a great way to network! Attending conferences is a great way to meet peers and like minded people who can help you grow. In return, as you gain experience you can help others grow as well!
2. Organizations- Join an organization such as ISSA and attend their meetups. This is a bit like conferences but on a smaller scale. You will meet people who are at different stages in their careers, get potential volunteering opportunities, and possibly even job leads! 
3. Digital Communities- Digital communities are social media sites, chat platforms, or forums. You can find groups on sites such as LinkedIn and Discord that share common interests to you. Participate in these communities and make friends/contacts!

### Job Boards

Here is a list of job boards in which you can hunt for jobs. There are many more out there so feel free to experiment! I've tried to limit this list to those boards that I have direct experience with or have heard positives reviews about. 

1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
2. [CyberSN](https://cybersn.com/public/search-jobs/)
3. [indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)
4. [dice](https://www.dice.com/)
5. [builtin](https://builtin.com/)

Outside of job boards it is worth going to the careers page of a company you are interested in working for. You can browse the offerings that a specific company has and apply directly from their careers page! 

### Additional Resources. 

In this section I want to shout out some additional resources that could be helpful in kickstarting your career.
