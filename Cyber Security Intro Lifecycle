# Introduction

Throughout my career I've been asked multiple times "How do I get into Cyber Security"? As this profession has become more and more integral to all sectors through the years I thought it was time to compile my thoughts and recommendations in a place I could easily reference and share. This idea evolved into what I am dubbing Cyber Security Intro Lifecycle (name is subject to change).
