# Grow

## Summary

You've got the job, congrats! That's not the end however. Within your current role you will have the opportunity to grow. In this context, that means:

1. Gain Experience
2. Build a professional network
### Gain Experience

This seems obvious I know, but I think it it warrants a deeper inspection on what this mean.

1. Study the business/Organization
2. Practice your craft
3. Ask questions
4. Take advantage of training resources

#### Study the business/Organization

This is something I have missed entirely in the past. I would focus on my experience alone, and fail think about my skills in relation to the goals of my team within the business. Take your time to understand what role you will play, what the businesses/organizations goals are, and how you fit in to all of it. Once you have this understanding, you can align your goals with that of business/organization.

The advantages of aligning your professional goals with that of the business/organization is you will gain experience in marketing yourself in the future. If/when you decide to move on from your current role being not only able to describe your skillset but how it helped drive success for your team to a hiring manager will be beneficial.

#### Practice Your Craft

This is the easy one! While you are working you will get to put your skills to use and therefore gain experience. Outside of the skills that you already possess and can improve upon, you may have the opportunity to participate in teams or projects that allow you to expand your skillset. In my experience the most effective growth minded managers tend to challenge their team with new initiatives or problems to solve.

Full disclosure, there will be some roles that will not promote growth and limit opportunities. In these cases it is prudent to keep up with your previous methods of learning new skills, something I encourage regardless. Continue pushing for growth where possible and when you feel you have reached your growth potential, prepare to move on.

#### Ask Questions

This is another pivotal part of growth. Ask questions from your managers, peers, mentors, or yes even internet forums. If you want to understand something and are having difficulty doing so, don't be shy to ask. This can range from troubleshooting a particular technology issue, to trends in the industry, to career advice. Since humans in our profession come from all sorts of backgrounds and have different experiences, you never know when you will receive "the best advice" that resonates with you.

#### Take Advantage Of  Training Resources

If you are fortunate enough to land a role with an business/organization that offers training resources, take advantage of them. These resources could look like certification reimbursement, a learning subscription, tuition reimbursement, or conference attendance. All of these things have potential value to your growth.


### Build Your Professional Network

That brings us to building your professional network. I've broken this down into two kinds of networking

1. Internal
2. External
#### Internal

Building your professional network from an internal perspective means connecting with those you work with. This could be your manager, peers, or even other teams! Your career is a long road and you never know when someone you made an impression on will think of your for a role! Remember that this connection goes both ways, and later down the road you might be approached by a former co-worker for a recommendation or a reference. 


#### External

Building your professional network eternally means finding connections outside of your employers influence. This is a very broad category. You can make connections with vendors, conference goers, content creators, or others with similar interests. Having a diverse and varied network can be advantageous.
